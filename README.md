### Internship Task: Event Ticketing Bot for Telegram

#### Objective
Develop a Telegram bot for event ticketing that allows users to obtain free tickets and adds them to a single Telegram group dedicated to the event.

#### Task Description
Your task is to create a Telegram bot using either PHP, Node.js, or Python that handles the following functionalities:
1. **Event Information:** Provides users with details about the event.
2. **Ticket Request:** Allows users to request free tickets through the bot.
3. **User Registration:** Collects necessary user information during the ticket request.
4. **Group Invitation:** Adds users to a specific Telegram group upon successful ticket request.

#### Requirements
- **Bot Commands:**
  - `/start` - Greets the user and provides event details.
  - `/register` - Initiates the ticket registration process.
  - `/help` - Provides help and usage instructions.

- **Ticket Request Process:**
  - Collect user's name, email, and number of tickets.
  - Confirm the request and send a ticket (can be a simple confirmation message with a unique ID).

- **Group Management:**
  - After successful ticket request, automatically add the user to the designated Telegram group.
  - Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions to add users to the group.

- **Database:**
  - Maintain a simple database (e.g., JSON, SQLite) to store user information and ticket details.

#### Submission Guidelines
- **Fork Repository:** To accept this task, fork the GitHub repository [EventRSVPBot]([https://github.com/CeyLabs-TGBot-EventRSVPBot](https://github.com/CeyLabs/CeyLabs-Intern-TGBot-EventRSVP/)) which contains the hello bot as a starting point.
- **GitHub Repository:** Ensure your forked repository contains:
  - Source code for the Telegram bot.
  - A README file with instructions on how to set up and run the bot.
  - Any necessary configuration files (e.g., `config.json` for bot tokens and group IDs).
  - Documented code for clarity and maintainability.

- **Telegram Group:** Add a section in the README with details on how to join the Telegram group you created for testing.
